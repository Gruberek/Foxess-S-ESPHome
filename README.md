Designing a custom pcb and enclosure is next on my to do list. I'll update here with the corresponding gerber and stl files when done. It should making the circuit a lot easier.

Some basic electronics skills (like soldering) are needed to realize this project. I do not take any responsibility for the use of this custom component or anything that it written down in this repository. Use at your own risk.
